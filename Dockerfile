# Build an image that can do training and inference in SageMaker
# This is a Python 2 image that uses the nginx, gunicorn, flask stack

# output stream, which means that logs can be delivered to the user quickly. PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
# keeps Python from writing the .pyc files which are unnecessary in this case. We also update
# PATH so that the train and serve programs are found when the container is invoked.
